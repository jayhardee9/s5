//! A very basic equation s5 for physics problems.
//!
//! This crate implements a s5 that consumes a set of equations modelling some system plus
//! known variable values and deduces values for as many other system variables as possible. See
//! [`solver_state`] for API usage.
//!
//! # Organization
//! The modules [`constants`], [`variables`] and [`formulas`] contain the types used for
//! constructing the equations that model your physics system, as well as providing known values
//! for your problem variables. See [`formulas`] for examples on building formulas.
//!
//! The [`solver_state`] module implements the s5 itself.
